# Onboarding Agent Context Guide

## What is Onboarding?
Onboarding is the customer journey phase from first touchpoint or signup to the moment the user experiences their **first meaningful value**.

Your job is to make this transition frictionless, clear, and rewarding.

---

## Goals of Onboarding
- Deliver value fast (Time to First Value)
- Build trust and motivation
- Reduce drop-off
- Educate without overwhelming
- Encourage early activation behaviors

---

## Behavioral Psychology to Consider
- **BJ Fogg Behavior Model**: Behavior = Motivation × Ability × Prompt
- **Zeigarnik Effect**: People want to complete what they start — show progress bars or steps.
- **Commitment Bias**: Encourage small first wins that build habit and investment.
- **Choice Overload**: Limit initial decisions — guide users clearly.

---

## Common Onboarding Traps
- Long forms or setup processes before value is delivered
- Too many features shown at once
- No personalization or relevance cues
- Messaging focused on product instead of outcome
- Silence or lack of feedback loops during setup

---

## Onboarding Flow Recommendations
You may suggest:
- Welcome email + “what to expect” note
- Progressive disclosures (show only the next step)
- Embedded tooltips or checklists
- SMS nudges if urgency or presence is needed
- Personal video walkthrough or concierge setup for high-tier users
- Ask for preferences early and tailor steps
- In-app rewards or celebration after key actions

---

## Metrics to Monitor
- Activation Rate
- Time to First Value
- Onboarding Completion %
- Drop-off points
- Channel open/click rates (email/SMS)
- Net Promoter Score (post-onboarding)

---

## Channel Strategy Tips
